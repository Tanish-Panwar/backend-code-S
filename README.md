Use Npm i to install all the required node modules.

If it gives error Please try to use "npm init" and initialize all the things according to your pc.

If "npm install" dosen't installs all the modules.

Install these packages. 

npm i pg <br/>
npm i body-parser <br/>
npm i express <br/>
npm i cors <br/>
npm i mongoose <br/>



If it doesn't works try to delete package.json and package-lock.json, node-modules
And try doing above steps again.
